# VLA-SMILES-descriptors
Numerical variable-length-array SMILES-based (VLA-SMILES) structural descriptors build upon traditional SMILES descriptors demonstrated (1) a higher learning speed when compared to the binary SMILES format; and (2) improved accuracy for selected VLA-SMILES representations [Nazarova, A.L.; Nakano, A.. Mach. Learn. Knowl. Extr. 2022, 4, 715-737].
This repository hosts Python code designed to generate Variable-Length-Array SMILES (VLA-SMILES) descriptors from molecular structures provided as SMILES strings in a .dat format (for example, 'ESOL.dat').

To execute the code, navigate to the root folder of the repository and run the following command in PowerShell:
py smiles_to_vla_smiles.py ESOL.dat

Additionally, the repository includes output files showcasing the various VLA-SMILES representations generated by this code.
